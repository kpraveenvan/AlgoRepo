//        c) such that a < b < c with c first, a second, and b third (possibly with other intervening
//        integers between c and a and between a and b).
//Numbers are pushed in Ascending order
//- for pop operation
//Since numbers are pushed in Ascending order just check if size of the stack >= 3!!
